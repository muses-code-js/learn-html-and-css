# Learn HTML and CSS

For the session we will have few 'Katas' - so-called exercise - on which we will work during the evening, we will be learning HTML & CSS. 

HTML is the foundation behind all web pages. It’s used to add structure and form to text, images, and more. 

CSS is the language used to style HTML content. 

In this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of both languages so that you can create visually appealing web pages. Each session is an independent session but if when we have some people returning from session to session we have a bigger challenge for them which they continue working on.
